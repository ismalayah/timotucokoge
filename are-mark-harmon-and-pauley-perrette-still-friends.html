As Leroy Jethro Gibbs and Abby Scutio, the actors brought a chemistry and an onscreen charisma that helped to make <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NCIS</a> the ratings giant that it remains today. Unfortunately, the chemistry they displayed on screen did not carry over into real life.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>Harmon and Perrette got along famously until 2017, when behind the scenes drama led to the latter exiting the show. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello! Magazine</a>, the tension between the two actors kicked off when Harmon’s dog bit a member of the crew, and Perrette asked that the dog no longer be brought onto the set. The request was not honored, and increasing tensions led to an agreement in which Harmon and Perrette no longer had to film scenes together.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Of course, given the relevance of both of their characters to NCIS, the arrangement proved difficult. Perrette told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS Sunday Morning</a> that she eventually buckled under the discomfort she was feeling onset, and decided to leave the show ahead of its sixteenth season. Things seemed relatively cordial, at least to the public, until Perrette took to X (formerly Twitter) to air out her grievances with Harmon and the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I refused to go low, that's why I've never told publicly what happened. But there are tabloid articles out there that are telling total lies about me. If you believe them? Please leave me alone. You clearly don't know me.

I feel I have to protect my crew, jobs and so many people. But at what cost? I don’t know. Just know, I’m trying to do the right thing, but maybe silence isn’t the right thing about crime. I’m… Just… ?” Several tweets followed, though they were cryptic in terms of what they were alluding to.</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>A year later, Perrette tweeted a refusal to rejoin NCIS, and stated that she was “terrified” of Harmon. She also said that she has nightmares about the actor attacking her. Harmon has never publicly discussed these comments, and the only real acknowledgement of Perrette’s statements on the part of CBS came in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">written statement</a>. They praised her performance on the show and vowed to create a more friendly workplace environment on the set.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>NO I AM NOT COMING BACK!

Perrette has continued to land television roles, with the most notable being a supporting role on the miniseries When We Rise (2017) and a starring role on the sitcom Broke (2020). While the specifics of what transpired between the two actors remains unclear, what is clear is that they did not get along, and the network had to go out of their way to make sure that they didn’t appear in the same scene together.</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>With that in mind, it’s safe to assume that Harmon and Perrette are not friends in real life, and they do not plan on being friends at any point in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yivsRmpJqqm2K1or7MqKVmmZ6ZerGt1KWcsmWgmr%2BzsdOtnGarpJ65rXnFq6CeppSofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-old-is-texako-rapper-age-and-instagram.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Old is Texako?
