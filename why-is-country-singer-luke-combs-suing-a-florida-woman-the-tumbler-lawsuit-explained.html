On Wednesday, Dec. 13, the “<a href=#>Fast Car</a>” singer explained in a social media post those lawsuit reports were also news to him.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>According to Tampa news outlet <a href=#>WFLA</a>, Nicole Harness of Florida — a Combs fan — has an online business selling homemade t-shirts and drink tumblers, and was one of several others named in an Illinois lawsuit brought by Combs.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Reportedly, Harness was convicted of selling unlicensed Combs products and ordered to pay the country star $250,000. Harness lives with health challenges, and her only source of income is her online business.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>Harness said she was unaware of the suit until after the case was closed, and later found a notice informing her of the matter in her junk email folder. She only learned of the verdict, she said, when she discovered her Amazon storefront income was frozen.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>Speaking with WFLA, Harness added, “It’s very stressful. I don’t have money to pay my bills. I just want this resolved. I didn’t mean any harm to Luke Combs. I quit selling the tumbler. I pulled it down. I just don’t understand.”</p><h2 id=h-neither-does-combs-apparently data-injectable=false>Neither does Combs, apparently</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Luke Combs 🎤 (@lukecombs)</a></p>via Luke Combs/Instagram</figure><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>As news of the lawsuit verdict spread, Luke Combs posted a response on social media explaining that, like Harness, he was surprised by the verdict, and what’s more, he had no idea the lawsuit was even happening.</p><p data-characters=26 data-current-count=26 data-injectable=false>Here’s what he said:</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>&nbsp;“I woke up to use the restroom and the first thing I saw was this. I’ve spent the last two hours trying to make this right…because I was completely and utterly unaware of this.” Combs did say he works with a company that goes after large-scale counterfeit sales of his merchandise, but never thought a small businessperson like Harness would be targeted.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>” … [A]pparently,” Combs added, “this woman, Nicole [Harness] has somehow gotten wrapped into that and that makes me absolutely sick to my stomach.”</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Combs went on to add he would send Harness $11,000, or about twice the amount she was unable to access in her Amazon storefront, invite her and her family to a show so that they can meet in person, and sell an official tumbler with proceeds benefitting Harness’ medical bills. Combs also indicated that the initial $11 grand payment would just be the first of many Harness should expect to receive from him.</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>Harness sold 18 Luke Combs tumblers for $20 a piece, totaling $380 in sales. As of this report, other defendants named in the Illinois court case were not disclosed.</p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn7Jlmah6pLvUp6ursV2otq%2BzxKtkpa2bmnqku8ybqmarpZ67qHnAZp2lp6KesaJ51qikmqZdqbWmedOupJuklad6ra3WrKyirF2axbG4wKKlnpxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./crank-lucas-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-604356-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Crank Lucas Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./category-pok-c3-a9mon-introduced-in-the-teal-mask.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Category:Pokmon introduced in The Teal Mask</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennifer-wynn-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-105644-html.html>Jennifer Wynn Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcus-olin-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-26924-html.html>Marcus Olin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-chubb-biography.html>Nick Chubb Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-mandalorian-season-3-leaked-set-photos-tease-last-jedi-connection.html>The Mandalorian season 3 leaked set photos tease Last Jedi connection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jackie-and-ryan-2015.html>Jackie &amp;amp; Ryan movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash.
