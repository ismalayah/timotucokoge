Fletcher uploaded a photo of the couple on Sept. 22 with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">caption</a>, “What do you buy someone that has it all? The gift that keeps on giving. I’ve bought you a lifetime of income, literally. Generational wealth! 28.8 acres BABY! I love you. Happy birthday ❤️ @moneybaggyo The deed is yours!”</p><p>Beauvais said when addressing the topic during the “Girl Chat” segment that Fletcher was “acting married” by buying the land without having that form of commitment. “That’s a huge gift to someone … that you’re not even married to. I feel like if a man gave me [28.8] acres, I would feel obligated to stay with him if it didn’t work because that is such a good gift.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot_2021-09-29-KYLESISTER-therealkylesister-•-Instagram-photos-and-videos-600x304.png><p>When asked if she would accept that lavish gift if it was given to her, the 54-year-old hesitantly responded, “I would probably accept it.” After the show’s clip went viral, both Fletcher and Yo commented on Beauvais’ statements.</p><p>The model told Beauvais as well as the other women from “The Real,” including Adrienne Bailon-Houghton, Loni Love and Jennie Mai-Jenkins to focus on their own “land” and love lives.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y’all don’t know the half of what he does for me mentally or financially.
