With Timothée Chalamet’s regular public appearances with Zendaya following the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">release of Dune: Part Two</a>, and lack thereof with his girlfriend Kylie, fans are speculating whether the two are still a thing.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>The 26-year-old media personality <strong><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a></strong> has been dating <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the 28-year-old actor</a> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Timothée Chalamet</a> </strong>following her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">split with her ex Travis Scott</a> in Jan. 2023. On Jan. 25, 2023, the two well-known celebrities went to the Jean-Paul Gaultier presentation during Paris Fashion Week. Later, relationship rumors were stoked when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie’s car was seen driving up to Timothée’s Beverly Hills residence</a> around the middle of April.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>However, rumors are now surfacing about an alleged breakup between the two after a year of dating. The suspicions have been floating around for weeks, only to be fueled even more by the recent online activities of Kylie Jenner. Also, this isn’t the first time the duo has sparked splitting rumors. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Life and Style magazine</a> previously reported on Aug. 2, 2023, that the young couple has called it quits <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seven months after they first sparked dating rumors</a>.</p><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=73 data-injectable=false>Though the rumors were debunked previously, could they be true this time?</p><h2 id=h-kylie-was-alone-on-v-day-sparking-first-break-up-speculations data-injectable=false>Kylie was alone on V-Day, sparking first break-up speculations</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kylie-Cosmetics.png><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>The couple made headlines just over a month ago at the Golden Globes in Jan. 2024 due to a drama surrounding Kylie purportedly preventing Selena Gomez from snapping a picture with her boyfriend Timothée Chalamet. This was the pair’s last public appearance, and it has been some time since Kylie and Timothée were spotted together at any event or in public.</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>Even on Feb. 14, Valentine’s Day this year, Kylie Jenner shared photographs on Instagram of herself alone, which prompted followers to inquire about her boyfriend’s absence on such a sentimental occasion. She also shared on her account that she had made Valentine’s Day gifts <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for her children</a>, saying “I’m excited for my Valentines to wake up.” Nevertheless, followers saw that Timothée was neither mentioned nor given a gift.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>Although this offered people a reason to speculate about a potential breakup, Timothée’s hectic schedule promoting his just-released movie may have made it reasonable for the two to be unable to spend the holiday together.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kylie was nowhere to be seen at the Dune premiere event, either</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>Another huge shock to Kylothee fans came when Kylie Jenner was absent from the Dune: Part Two premiere event, too. Just one day after Valentine’s Day, on February 15, 2024, the world premiere of Dune: Part Two took place in London’s Odeon Luxe Leicester Square. Fans were clearly outraged by Kylie’s absence, since Kaia Gerber and Tom Holland showed up at the afterparty in London to support their respective partners, Austin Butler and Zendaya.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kylie and Timothée are still very much a thing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/bones-and-all-timothee-chalamet.jpg><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>Sources close to Kylie and Timothée have previously warned fans while speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> to “not to believe everything they read.” Maybe it’s time fans remember the advice. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The celebrity couple has been keeping their relationship secretive</a> ever since they started dating, and just because Kylie and the Dune actor haven’t been spotted together in public doesn’t mean they’ve broken up.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Timothée has always been very discreet about his romantic relationships. Kylie has not come forward to comment on the matter, either. Given that neither of the two has officially confirmed the split, the two seem to be together for now.<strong> </strong>There may be a few bumps on the road, or the two just might be busy working.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=false>Timothée is currently all caught up with Dune: Part Two promotions, and Kylie is busy promoting her new solo fragrance, COSMIC. Hopefully, we can soon see a paparazzi click of Kylothee together to set things straight about their relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Sus7GMpLCloZVit6a6zZ6pZpmemXq1tcyoq6GdlWKwqa3LmqSerF2owaq4y2abmqyZo7RuwMeeZKyonJ7BtbXNoGSrrZ2kv7R5xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brigitte-virtudes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brigitte Virtudes movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pattern-bush.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pattern Bush - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennifer-wynn-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-105644-html.html>Jennifer Wynn Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcus-olin-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-26924-html.html>Marcus Olin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-chubb-biography.html>Nick Chubb Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-mandalorian-season-3-leaked-set-photos-tease-last-jedi-connection.html>The Mandalorian season 3 leaked set photos tease Last Jedi connection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jackie-and-ryan-2015.html>Jackie &amp;amp; Ryan movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash.
