He working in his small Manchester, New Hampshire garage in order to provide a decent life for daughter Crystal (<a href=#>Ciara Bravo</a>), a high school senior who has just been accepted into college, and who he has been raising alone since the departure of his ex Karen (<a href=#>Jordana Spiro</a>). Helping him out are his two best pals, Terrance (<a href=#>Jon Bernthal</a>) and Packie (<a href=#>Shea Whigham</a>), who love Crystal as much as he does but whose boozy self-destructiveness inevitably causes him all sorts of grief. After a Christmas excursion to a local bar ends in yet another stupid brawl that culminates with Crystal witnessing Frank nearly beating a guy to death, the three friends break up and go their separate ways.</p><p>Three months pass and Frank lures both Terrance and Packie back to the garage one evening under false pretenses in order to mend fences. The two are wary at first but after the inevitable wave of insults and recriminations, they reconnect and settle in for a night consisting of rehashing old stories while chomping on red meat and washing it down with the good Scotch. Frank even has a local college kid, Chad (<a href=#>Spencer House</a>), coming by with some molly for dessert. I will say no more except to point out that what initially looks like a night of aggressive male bonding takes a decisive turn for the ugly as Frank’s intentions are finally revealed.&nbsp;</p><p>During my post-viewing&nbsp;attempt to understand how such a grimly unappealing work came to be, I discovered that the film is based on a play Pollono wrote and that was produced&nbsp;in 2011 to some acclaim. It would appear Pollono has made two key changes with this self-adaptation&nbsp;that were presumably done in order to open it up dramatically and in terms of attracting a potentially wider audience, but which end up doing it no favors at all. On stage, the characters of Crystal and Karen were referred to but evidently never actually seen; now they turn up here in the flesh in the evident hopes of keeping the film from seeming like an overt testosterone fest. Great, but Pollono’s screenplay gives those characters so little to do during those scenes they might as well still be on the sidelines. It also appears that on stage, the narrative consisted entirely of the fraught reunion in the garage;&nbsp;Pollono has now&nbsp;elected to add on the opening section to include wider locations and give a better sense of the characters prior to the meat of the story. However, since nothing of real consequence appears in this section outside of the bar fight, we have to sit through a lot of unnecessary introductory scenes before finally arriving at the equally unnecessary central plot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46spJqknGKyr7PIp5xmqpWlrqq%2BjKamr6GVYr%2BmwsiermZqYGd%2B</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./movie-review-john-woos-new-action-film-silent-night-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Theres No Heroism or Fantasy in John Woos Brutal Silent Night</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./daye-jack-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-629754-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Daye Jack Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennifer-wynn-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-105644-html.html>Jennifer Wynn Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcus-olin-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-26924-html.html>Marcus Olin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-chubb-biography.html>Nick Chubb Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-mandalorian-season-3-leaked-set-photos-tease-last-jedi-connection.html>The Mandalorian season 3 leaked set photos tease Last Jedi connection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jackie-and-ryan-2015.html>Jackie &amp;amp; Ryan movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash.
