Although some might frown upon Disney tattoos, that never stopped certain celebrities from honoring the House of Mouse with permanent dedications. There’s no shortage of creativity among these stars, some of whom tatted portraits of characters on their skin, while others referenced Disney in less obvious yet inventive ways.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>From TV stars to wrestling sensations, these celebrities — like Peter Pan — never wanted to grow up, but they’re perfectly content with that. And now, they’ve got some eye-popping ink out of it.</p><h2 id=h-pete-davidson data-injectable=false>Pete Davidson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pete-Davidson-Tattoos.jpg><p data-characters=598 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>Big-time actor and comedian <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pete Davidson</a> has two Disney-themed tattoos, one of which being a portrait of Winnie the Pooh holding a balloon (located on the side of his stomach) and the other being the words “Jasmine and Aladdin” underneath his collarbone. We’re not too certain what the story behind Winnie the Pooh might be, but Davidson had the Aladdin tattoo done to commemorate his SNL appearance as the character alongside his then-girlfriend Kim Kardashian. Artist Mira Mariah publicly commented on Davidson’s Winnie the Pooh tattoo, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">writing</a> “Thanks Pete.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Joe-Jonas-and-Sophie-Turner-Tattoos.jpg><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=815 data-injectable=true>In 2016, former Jonas Brother, Joe Jonas, began dating English actress Sophie Turner. The pair were engaged by October 2017 and later married in May 2019. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider</a> reports, tattooist Mr. K designed the matching ink for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">then-engaged couple</a> before they married, writing “To infinity” on Jonas’ wrist and “& beyond” on Turner’s, a nod to the catchphrase of Toy Story‘s Buzz Lightyear. Along with the cursive, the tattoos feature two tiny stars and a small spaceship.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Janet Jackson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Janet-Jackson-Tattoo.jpg><p data-characters=603 data-current-count=903 data-injectable=true>It was common knowledge for quite some time that Janet Jackson had a Disney-themed tattoo, but she wasn’t ever too eager to show it. It was later made public that Jackson’s tattoo featured an explicit sexual act between Mickey and Minnie Mouse, so that might not be the most appropriate artwork to advertise. The tattoo is located on Jackson’s groin area, but there have been very few glimpses of the ink. When asked about the tattoo, Jackson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>: “I have a tattoo on my most private part of Mickey and Minnie Mouse involved in a sexual act. It’s my sense of humor.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jenni “JWoww” Farley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jenni-Jwoww-Farley-Tattoos.jpg><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=795 data-injectable=true>Jersey Shore star Jenni “JWoww” Farley rose to prominence as one of the eight main stars of the reality TV show, then returned in a main role for the spin-offs, Snooki & Jwoww and Jersey Shore: Family Vacation. Instead of following the crowd and getting Disney tattoos inspired by famous love stories, Farley decided to base her sleeve on “happily never after,” a concept that flips Disney fairytales to make them more “rooted in reality,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Inked</a>.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>“So with Ariel and Eric, Eric is looking away like he wants nothing to do with her and Ariel is looking at him with desperate puppy eyes,” she continued. “For ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ he is a real beast. Sleeping Beauty overdosed and is dead. Her prince is crying over her because he knows that he pushed her to that limit.”</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>“And Cinderella’s prince is beating her,” Farley added. “To me, that is the reality of relationships, they are crazy and take hard work — not that happily ever after bullshit.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Chiara Ferragni</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chiara-Ferragni-Tattoos.jpg><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>According to her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, Ferragni got her Disney-themed tattoo 10 years ago in November 2013. She later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">customized a phone case</a> to match her ink. When asked what her most unusual tattoo might be, she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glamour</a>, “I would say Mickey Mouse taking a selfie. I loved the idea so much, I still can’t remember how I got that. I was in L.A. and I immediately had to call my tattoo artist to get an appointment.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Chris Zylka</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chris-Zylka-Paris-Tattoo.jpg><p data-characters=652 data-current-count=952 data-injectable=true>You might recognize him as Flash Thompson in The Amazing Spider-Man, but Chris Zylka’s dating history might be even more notable than his filmography. After initially dating actress Lucy Hale and becoming engaged to model Hanna Beth Merjos, Zylka eventually found what he thought to be his true love in media personality Paris Hilton, whom he proposed to in January 2018. By November 2018, the couple had called off the engagement, though not before Zylka had ‘Paris’ tattooed on his forearm in Disney’s iconic font, a nod to both Disneyland Paris and his then-fiancée. He later covered the tattoo with a portrait of a gorilla.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ryan Cabrera</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ryan-Cabrera-Disney-Tattoo.jpg><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=900 data-injectable=true>You’ll either know him as the lead singer for the Dallas band Rubix Groove or “Alexa Bliss’ husband.” Either way, Cabrera has made a name for himself as a successful musician and devoted husband. In 2019, Cabrera began dating WWE star Alexa Bliss, whom he proposed to in November 2020. By April 2022, the couple were married, and in May 2023, they announced that their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first child was due</a> to be born in December 2023. Cabrera, like Davidson, has two Disney-themed tattoos; an outline of Mickey Mouse’s head on his hand and a portrait of the mascot on his opposite wrist.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Alexa Bliss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Alexa-Bliss-Disney-Tattoo.jpg><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=825 data-injectable=false>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a> from 2018, Alexa Bliss confirmed that the coordinates in her white-ink tattoo led to Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, which she describes as her “happy place.” In an interview with WWE, Bliss <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that she’s been an avid Disney fan since the age of three, a trait she attributes to her family’s annual visits to Walt Disney World. Before marrying Cabrera, Bliss was dating Buddy Matthews, who himself now dates fellow Australian Rhea Ripley.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SGbq%2FEpZybqpmptqa%2FjLCgraBdmba0usSyZK2glaKypXnTmqutp5%2BofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./house-of-sand-and-fog-2003.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>House of Sand and Fog movie review (2003)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stevie-ray-vaughanspride-and-joy-lyrics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stevie Ray VaughansPride And Joy Lyrics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennifer-wynn-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-105644-html.html>Jennifer Wynn Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcus-olin-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-26924-html.html>Marcus Olin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-chubb-biography.html>Nick Chubb Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-mandalorian-season-3-leaked-set-photos-tease-last-jedi-connection.html>The Mandalorian season 3 leaked set photos tease Last Jedi connection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jackie-and-ryan-2015.html>Jackie &amp;amp; Ryan movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash.
