In addition to appearing in HBO’s Euphoria, now in its second season, the 24-year-old actress has had career-turning roles in The White Lotus, Sharp Objects, Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale, and Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>On top of everything else, she’s even started her own production company, Fifty-Fifty Films, where she’s currently adapting Jessica Goodman’s novel They Wish They Were Us for an upcoming HBO Max series that she’ll star in with her real-life best friend Halsey.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>So what does an extremely busy actress and burgeoning producer do in her spare time? Well, Sweeney also moonlights as a mechanic, fixing up old cars — naturally!</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>Sweeney first opened up about her bright red original 1969 Ford Bronco <a href=#>in Teen Vogue last September</a>, which she purchased from a car auction website during quarantine despite having no prior experience fixing up old cars.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>“I’ve always wanted a Bronco, and I got one,” she revealed in that article. “I called up my friend’s dad and was like, ‘I need a space in your shop.'”</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>But you wouldn’t know that, because early last year, Sweeney began documenting her journey rebuilding the classic truck on her aptly-named <a href=#>Syd’s Garage</a> TikTok account. She’s since replaced the brakes, swapped out the suspension, and changed out the transmission from manual to automatic, as you can see in just one of her many videos, below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true><a title=@syds_garage href=#>@syds_garage</a><p>getting my bronco ready for the new transmission <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="♬ Aesthetic - Xilo" href=#>♬ Aesthetic – Xilo</a></figure><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>“Watching Euphoria actress Sydney Sweeney remove a rear axle” was probably not something you expected to come across today, but here we are.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true><a title=@syds_garage href=#>@syds_garage</a><p>removed the rear axel (which is insanely heavy) <a title=bronco href=#>#bronco</a></p><a title="♬ So Fine - Trees and Lucy" href=#>♬ So Fine – Trees and Lucy</a></figure><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>Sweeney finished the mechanical components last fall and then got to work on remodeling the interior and putting on finishing touches, such as shiny new chrome letters.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true><a title=@syds_garage href=#>@syds_garage</a><p>finally had a day off today and stopped by the shop.

I was very bored and I got addicted to going to auction sites for cars. I wanted a Bronco so badly. But I wanted to build one so that when I drove it and people said ‘cool car,’ I could be like ‘yeah, thanks’ and know I made it.”</p><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=84 data-injectable=false>We’re sure she’ll have no problem finding people admiring her handiwork.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9Kym6edqWLAuLHEp5yyZaSeuLW7ymaYnJufqru1ecWir6Kml2LCsXnVoqWtmZeaeqSt0axm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pattern-bush.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pattern Bush - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-peggy-fleming-see-net-worth-quote-awards-fact-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Peggy Fleming?
