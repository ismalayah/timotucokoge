Can T.J. Hockenson once again lead the way as Josh Dobbs' new favorite target? Will Sam LaPorta eat in a great matchup against the division rival Chicago Bears? Is George Kittle going to take a step back with all hands on deck for the 49ers again?</p><p>We'll answer those questions and more with the Week 11 fantasy football tight end rankings. But first, let's take a look at a few viable streaming options that may be available on your league's waiver wire:</p><h2><strong>Streaming Tight End Options For Week 11</strong></h2><p><strong>Michael Mayer, LV (@ MIA):&nbsp;</strong>Mayer hauled in his first career touchdown reception last week, but this is more about the likely game flow against the Dolphins more than anything else. Las Vegas should have to throw a ton to keep pace with Miami's explosive offense, and with the Dolphins' secondary healthy once again, Mayer could be a valuable safety blanket for rookie quarterback Aidan O'Connell. This is a volume play, but getting pass catchers on teams likely to be playing from behind is a good streaming bet at the tight end position.</p><p><strong>Tyler Conklin, NYJ (@ BUF):&nbsp;</strong>Rolling with Conklin requires a similar thought process. The Bills are approaching must-win territory after a brutal Monday night loss, and should be ahead at home in this one. Conklin has 13 catches for 137 yards over the last two weeks, and is clearly a preferred target of Zach Wilson. Touchdowns may be hard to come by, but Conklin's target share is definitely worth scooping on the waiver wire if you're in need during these bye weeks.</p><h2><strong>NFL Fantasy Football Week 11 Tight End Rankings</strong></h2><p><strong>1.

Hockenson</strong> was supposed to be slightly limited for last week, then he had one of the best games of his season instead. Not overreacting to Sunday morning reports remains one of the biggest edges in fantasy…<strong>Mark Andrews</strong> is coming off his worst game of the year, but expect&nbsp;Lamar Jackson to go back to where his bread is buttered this week…</p><p><strong>Dalton Kincaid&nbsp;</strong>has finished in the top-8 at tight end in PPR fantasy football leagues in four consecutive weeks. Stefon Diggs is going to get the squeaky wheel treatment, but Kincaid has clearly become Josh Allen's next favorite target in Buffalo…The Bears allow the <a href=# rel=noopener>5th most points</a> to opposing fantasy tight ends, and <strong>Sam LaPorta</strong> has one of the best fantasy floors at the position thanks to his target share…It's hard to predict the boom/bust weeks for&nbsp;<strong>George Kittle</strong>, but he's been on a nice roll with three top-3 tight end weekly finishes in his last five games…</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Top-5-Fantasy-Football-Sleepers-At-Tight-End-In-2023-Ranked-DO-NOT-PUB-YET-MOVE-TO-NEEDS-EDITING.jpg alt="Fantasy Football, Fantasy Football Tight End Sleepers, TE Sleepers, Pat Freiermuth, Dalton Kincaid, Foster Moreau" width=1200 height=673 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Dalton Schultz&nbsp;</strong>has been on fire, with five top-8 weekly finishes in his last six appearances. If Nico Collins sits again, you could argue Schultz should be a top-5 selection at tight end in Week 11…<strong>Trey McBride</strong> caught 8 passes for 131 yards in his first game with Kyler Murray, so it's wheels up for ascending tight end in what could be a fun shootout against the Texans…Make it three straight top-12 PPR tight end finishes for&nbsp;<strong>Cole Kmet</strong>, who has proven to be trustworthy no matter who is at QB for the Bears…<strong>Jake Ferguson&nbsp;</strong>has scored in three straight games, and Dak Prescott is on fire right now. Keep going back to the well…</p><p>As the depth at the fantasy tight end position has improved, <strong>Evan Engram</strong> has steadily fallen down the rankings. He's solid, but not providing the touchdown potential we so desperately need…<strong>David Njoku&nbsp;</strong>has quietly been pretty solid with Deshaun Watson, but the Steelers defend the position very well (5th least points allowed to fantasy tight ends)…<strong>Michael Mayer </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Tyler Conklin&nbsp;</strong>are fantasy football dart throws, but both should be the beneficiaries of their teams playing from behind in Week 11,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnKrBpLTPqKCnrKNjsLC5jp%2BYp6yRqMZuss6oq5uZnKF6tbXGoatmnZ6ZerOtzaSgp5%2BjYsSmscpmaGplYmV%2FdA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lizzo-dazzles-with-stunning-grammys-performance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lizzo dazzles with stunning performance at Grammys and another award win</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./all-cameo-appearances-in-the-flash.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All cameo appearances in The Flash</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennifer-wynn-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-105644-html.html>Jennifer Wynn Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcus-olin-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-26924-html.html>Marcus Olin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-chubb-biography.html>Nick Chubb Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-mandalorian-season-3-leaked-set-photos-tease-last-jedi-connection.html>The Mandalorian season 3 leaked set photos tease Last Jedi connection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jackie-and-ryan-2015.html>Jackie &amp;amp; Ryan movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash.
